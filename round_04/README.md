Rust has a tiered error-handling scheme:

```txt
If something might reasonably be absent, Option is used.
If something goes wrong and can reasonably be handled, Result is used.
If something goes wrong and cannot reasonably be handled, the thread panics.
If something catastrophic happens, the program aborts.
```
